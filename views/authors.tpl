        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Hello there! I'm Karol, a passionate individual with a deep love for programming. As someone who finds joy in the intricacies of coding, I constantly seek new challenges to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology. Whether it's unraveling complex algorithms or building innovative solutions, I thrive on the creativity and problem-solving aspects of programming. Outside the digital realm, I also find solace in the soothing waters of swimming, a hobby that complements the analytical nature of my programming pursuits. It's a perfect balance, allowing me to dive into both the virtual and physical realms with equal enthusiasm.</p>
